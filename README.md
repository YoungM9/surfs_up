Introduction

For this challenge the goal was to see if an ice cream shop was a sustainable venture at a beach. To determine this we looked at the temperatures in the hottest month and in the coldest month.

Analysis

- June has a higher max temp than December (83 versus 85)
- Decemebers lowest temperature is 53 degrees
- The average temperature of both months is 71 versus 74 degrees

The difference in min and max temp in june is 21 degress whilist the difference between the min and max in december is 27 degrees is significant because both of their maximum measured values are in the 80's which means that there will only be a substantial amount of variation in temperature. I would say that the weather allows for there to be an ice cream shop stationed all year round without worrying about a drastic change in weather that would stop customers from buying ice cream.

Additional queries that we can do involves making a table of percent changes, different kinds of weather, etcc
